# Merge Profiles Module

The Merge Profiles Module allows administrators to easily move orders from one user account to another. This functionality is particularly useful when managing duplicate accounts or when customers wish to consolidate their order history under a single profile.

## Features

- **Move Orders Between Accounts**: Seamlessly transfer orders from one user profile to another.
- **Profile Consolidation**: Helps maintain a clean and organized user database by merging duplicate profiles.
- **Order History Preservation**: Ensure that order history and related details are preserved accurately during the merge process.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Merge Profiles Tool**: Navigate to the admin panel and select the option to merge profiles.
2. **Select Profiles**: Choose the source profile (the one from which orders will be moved) and the target profile (the one to which orders will be transferred).
3. **Select Orders**: Choose the specific orders you wish to move. You can select multiple orders at once.
4. **Merge Profiles**: Confirm the operation to move the selected orders to the target profile.
